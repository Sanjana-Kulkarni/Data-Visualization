# Data-Visualization

# Overview
Here we primarily focused on data visualization using Python libraries (Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib). The objective was to recreate a visualization akin to Hans Rosling's motion graph, delving into global health indicators, life expectancy, fertility rates, and population trends from 1960 to 2016.
